# Food-Rescue-Connect
Food Rescue Connect is a community-based initiative aimed at reducing urban food waste while simultaneously addressing food insecurity. It acts as a real-time platform connecting restaurants, grocery stores, and food producers with NGOs, shelters, and food banks to redistribute surplus food efficiently and ethically.
